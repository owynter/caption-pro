# âœ… Grid and Snap Fixes Complete

## ðŸŽ¯ Issues Fixed:

### **1. Snap to Grid Functionality:**
- âœ… **Fixed Logic**: Changed from `canvasState.gridSize > 0` to `canvasState.snapToGrid`
- âœ… **Proper Behavior**: Snap to grid now works when the "Snap" button is clicked
- âœ… **Shift Key Override**: Hold Shift while dragging to bypass grid snapping for fine positioning
- âœ… **Smooth Movement**: Text elements now snap to grid positions when dragging

### **2. Grid Button Clickable Area:**
- âœ… **Added Padding**: Both Grid and Snap buttons now have `px-4` for larger clickable area
- âœ… **Better UX**: Buttons are easier to click and have consistent sizing
- âœ… **Visual Feedback**: Active state (bg-secondary) properly applied to both buttons

### **3. Grid Density Reduction:**
- âœ… **Reduced Density**: Grid size increased from 20px to 30px
- âœ… **Cleaner Look**: About 33% fewer grid lines for less visual clutter
- âœ… **Better Spacing**: Grid is now less dense and easier to use for alignment

### **4. Grid Visibility:**
- âœ… **Proper Drawing Order**: Grid is drawn on top of background but behind text
- âœ… **Solid Lines**: Changed from dashed to solid lines for better visibility
- âœ… **Better Contrast**: Darker color (#666666) with 0.8 opacity for clear visibility
- âœ… **Automatic Redraw**: Canvas redraws when grid visibility changes

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation:

### **Snap to Grid Fix:**
```jsx
// Before (broken):
if (canvasState.gridSize > 0 && !event.shiftKey) {
  const snapped = snapToGrid(newX, newY);
  newX = snapped.x;
  newY = snapped.y;
}

// After (working):
if (canvasState.snapToGrid && !event.shiftKey) {
  const snapped = snapToGrid(newX, newY);
  newX = snapped.x;
  newY = snapped.y;
}
```

### **Grid Button Improvements:**
```jsx
// Added consistent padding:
className={`px-4 ${canvasState.gridVisible ? "bg-secondary" : ""}`}
className={`px-4 ${canvasState.snapToGrid ? "bg-secondary" : ""}`}
```

### **Grid Density:**
```jsx
// Reduced from 20px to 30px spacing:
gridSize: 30
```

## ðŸ“± User Experience Improvements:

### **Before:**
- Snap button didn't work (checked wrong state)
- Grid buttons had small clickable areas
- Grid was too dense (20px spacing)
- Grid visibility was inconsistent

### **After:**
- Snap button works correctly for grid snapping
- Grid buttons have larger, more clickable areas
- Grid is less dense and easier to use (30px spacing)
- Grid is clearly visible and properly positioned

## ðŸŽ¨ Result:
- **Functional snap to grid** for precise text positioning
- **Better button usability** with larger clickable areas
- **Cleaner grid overlay** that's less visually cluttered
- **Improved alignment tools** for professional text layout
- **Consistent behavior** between grid visibility and snap functionality
